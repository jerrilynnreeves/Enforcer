== Enforcer vs Spring Security ACL and others?

So why would you want to use Enforcer?

With Enforcer I try to set you up to be successful, in enforcing business rules/permissions, in a way that is easy to
read, and is expendable, without the limitations I see in other frameworks. So lets take a look at alternatives, and how Enforcer
addresses some of there limitations.

=== Spring Security ACL

. It's annotations use the Spring EL language, which is a DSL for Spring, which is less powerful, and less flexible than Groovy.
. It uses a "bit mask" for storing permission, while this is "efficient", but hard to read, also we're not in the 80's anymore, and disk is cheap.
. It uses a highly normalized set for domains/tables for storing permission. This means that querying the db will involve many joins, which will slow down the writing and running of queries.
. Updating permission especially in bulk can be really slow, because of the built-in caching. If you use direct SQL you have to invalidate the plug-ins internal cache.
. The annotation is a Spring Proxy, so it only gets called if you are calling from outside the class, the annotation is in. This can lead to a false sense of security, or false negatives.
. If you are not using a hierarchy for your permission, which I don't see a config option for, you will end up with a lot of permissions in the db. I've seen it as bad as 400,000 permission entries for just over a 1000 containers.
. Extending the plug-in is not straight forward. Adding new permissions isn't bad, but you have to deal with the "bit mask". However if you want to add functions that can be called in the EL expression... good luck.  Adding new functions that you can call would involve some been overrides,  and extending classes. I've tried it twice and it didn't work either time.  I do think however you maybe able to call services from within the EL, with the current version, but don't quote me on that.
. It's somewhat hard to setup tests for your annotations.

=== Shiro
. I'll be honest I don't really get Shiro, and I haven't taken the time to understand it. The permissions aren't as readable as I would like.
. I know the library of Shiro, not the plugin does have annotations, but I suspect that they would have the same issue that the spring security has, being proxies.

=== Drools
. I never used it, but I haven't heard good things, and from what I can see the plugins are not being actively maintained.

=== GContracts
. It seems the last commit was 4 years ago, and it wasn't meant to work with Grails:

=== Enforcer in response:
. Use a closure, so you have the full flexibility of groovy, your IDE, will help you, and will do syntax highlighting.
. The default DomainRole, uses a string which is easy to read and query.
. The DomainRole is denormalized, so that it will be quicker, and involves less queries to read, and write.
. As said before DomainRole is denormalized so it's quick to update.
. The Enforce AST transform/annotation runs every time a method it's annotation is called, unless your are running from the test environment.
. DomainRole uses a hierarchy by default so you'll have less entries in the db, which will be easier to query, and migrate if you have too. That 400,000 for 1000 contains was reduced to 20,000 entries using a hierarchy.
. Extending Enforcer is easy, by adding methods to either of the traits the InstalledEnforcerService uses, or adding your own trait, to just calling any service from with in the closure(s) you pass in.
. You could even use other frameworks, and integrate them in, using traits, based of the InstalledEnforcerService.
. Testing is easy see the EnforcerServiceSpec for examples.

For the rest I don't see them as viable competition at this point, mainly, because most of them aren't being maintained.
All of these tools had their usage, but I think it's time for something better, and in the future maybe a better plugin
will be written, than Enforcer.
