After you run the Enforcer quick start script, in your services you will have the InstalledEnforcerService, the RoleTrait and the DomainRole Trait.
The InstalledEnforcerService, by default implements the two traits, RoleTrait, and DomainRoleTrait. This is so you can use the methods
in the traits, without injecting any extra calls to services, which the Enforcer checks less verbose, and
easier to read. The preferred method of extending the Enforcer Service is to add new trait with new methods, or add new methods to the existing
 traits. These traits make the EnforcerService, and by extension the annotations into a DSL for enforcing business rules/permissions. The
 traits should just be seen as a suggested starting point. You could add whatever you need like project, group, feature flag checks, etc.
