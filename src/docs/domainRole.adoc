== DomainRole
The DomainRole, is the default for enforcing permissions, This should be seen as a starting point implementation, but can be replace, with
your own implementation for permissions(see Extending Enforcer section).

=== DomainRole domain
The DomainRole is the default domain class for holding permission.

[source,groovy]
----
class DomainRole {
    String role        //The role to apply to the object
    Long   domainId    //The id of the object
    String domainName  //The domain name of the object
    User   user        //The user associated with the permission
    Date   dateCreated
    Date   lastUpdated
----

It is meant to be simple, linking a role to a domain object(id, and className), and a user

=== DomainRole trait
This trait, which is applied to the enforcerService by the install, gives you the following methods:
[source,groovy]
----
    /**
     *  This method will check if a user(defaulting to the currently logged in user),
     *  has a DomainRole on an object.
     *
     *  @param  role the role to check to see if the user has on the domainObject
     *  @param domainObject the instance of the domain object to check if the user
     *  has a DomainRole on
     *  @param user the user to check if  it has the role on the domain object,
     *  defaults to null which is swapped for springSecurityService.currentUser
     *  @return true if the user has the DomainRole or the DomainRole fall in to
     *  the following hierarchy and false other wise:
     *  Map roleHierarchy = [
     *            owner : ['owner', 'editor', 'viewer'],
     *            editor: ['editor', 'viewer'],
     *            viewer: ['viewer']
     *  ]

     * This method checks the domain object to see if it has a reference to a
     * user(passed in or defaulted to springSecurityService.currentUser)

     * to that object.
     *
     * @param domainObject The domain object to check for a user reference
